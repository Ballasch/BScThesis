\section*{Abstract}
\begin{english}
Differential measurement of the $tq\gamma$ process in the Standard Model would enable investigations of the electromagnetic coupling of the top quark. 
Regarding this measurement of $tq\gamma$ with the full Run-2 dataset at the ATLAS experiment, a neural network is trained on data from Monte Carlo simulations to discriminate background processes from the $tq\gamma$ signal process. 
Certain features of events are provided as input to the neural network. 
In this thesis, the influence of these input features on the neural network's ability to separate signals from the background is investigated. This provides insights into which event features are essential characteristics to understand the electromagnetic coupling of the top quark.
